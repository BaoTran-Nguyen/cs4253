# Project 2: Minimax, Alpha-Beta Game Tree Search and Reinforcement Learning

In this project, you will complete an agent and an evaluation function
to play a discretized version of soccer.

## Usage

From the root directory, run

    python3 evaluate.py proj2

This will run a version of the game where both players choose actions
randomly. If you would like to play against the agent, run

    python3 evaluate.py proj2 --interactive

For any help on additional commands to use, run

    python3 evaluate.py proj2 --help
